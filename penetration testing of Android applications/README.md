The purpose of this masterâ€™s thesis was to design and implement a system utilizing the advantages provided by modern generative artificial intelligence models in the field of cybersecurity, based on the analysis conducted. To fulfill this purpose, our work focuses on automated penetration testing of mobile Android applications using large language models (LLM) and other available tools. The work addresses the detection of security threats and vulnerabilities in mobile applications with the goal of enhancing their security and resilience against attacks. The system combines multiple analytical techniques for a deeper understanding of potential security weaknesses and provides an administrative panel for displaying results and data analysis. The first part of the work is dedicated to an overview of the technologies used, their capabilities, and limitations in application analysis. The next part of the work describes the actual implementation of the system, detailing the architecture and components of the system, including integration processes and the user interface. In the final part, the results of the system testing and statistics on the success of detection in test applications are presented.

Keywords: large language models, Android application security, automatization, penetra- tion testing
